## Response 1: Modern Minimalist with Warmth
**Design Movement:** Contemporary Scandinavian + Edutech-friendly
**Probability:** 0.08

**Core Principles:**
- Generous whitespace with purposeful breathing room between sections
- Warm, approachable color palette that feels professional yet human
- Subtle micro-interactions that feel natural, not forced
- Typography-driven hierarchy with strategic font pairing

**Color Philosophy:**
- Primary: Warm slate-blue (#3B4A5C) - professional, trustworthy, calm
- Accent: Warm amber (#D4A574) - energy, optimism, approachability
- Backgrounds: Off-white (#F8F7F5) with subtle warmth
- Supporting: Soft sage (#A8B8A8) for secondary elements
- Reasoning: Warm neutrals create approachability for busy tutors while maintaining premium positioning

**Layout Paradigm:**
- Asymmetric hero with text on left, subtle illustration/pattern on right
- Staggered section layouts alternating left/right content
- Feature cards in 2-column grid on desktop, single column mobile
- Generous vertical rhythm with 4rem+ spacing between major sections

**Signature Elements:**
- Subtle animated dot patterns in brand colors (appears in hero, fades throughout)

**Interaction Philosophy:**
- Smooth scroll behavior with gentle fade-in animations

- Form inputs with floating labels and smooth focus transitions
- CTA buttons with soft glow on hover

**Animation Guidelines:**
- All transitions 300-400ms with ease-out timing
- Entrance animations on scroll (fade + slide up, 600ms)
- Hover effects are subtle (shadow deepens, color shifts 50ms)
- No parallax; keep animations functional and supportive

**Typography System:**
- Display: "Sohne" or "Outfit" (bold, geometric, modern) for headings
- Body: "Inter" or "Geist" (clean, readable) for copy
